As you can see on the above screenshot. By default, rolisteam has 3
music players. You can use them to play two or tree song/music at the
same time. It allows you to have background music, sound effects and
environment sounds at the same time. The goal is to improve the
experience.

### Play music

Rolisteam is not streaming any audio file. It send stream information
(such as URL) or filename to play. If you want to play your own audio
files. You must send them to each of your players. Your players must put
them into one directory and them, set the directory as music directory
in audio player (player mode).

Rolisteam can not be used as streaming server. So, music files are not
transferred to each players. There are two reasons for that:

-   Bandwidth issue
-   This feature may make rolisteam dangerous for copyright etc
