This window lists all the chats in which you can read and write. The check box indicates whether the chat window is displayed or not. You can check and uncheck to show or hide the corresponding window. The color indicates whether there are unread messages in the chat. If the color is green is that you have read everything. Otherwise, it is red.

# Kinds of chat

There are three kinds of chat rooms:
*The Common chat which everyone is enrolled automatically. It is in this chat that the game is mostly played. 
*The private chats (Paul and Jaques in the example) that enable talking to a player without the others reading it. As the Common chat they are created automatically. 
*The chats on demand (HRP in the example) that can be created when it is needed and involving a list of players that can be modified.

# Creating a chat

Any player can create a chat on demand. 
*Click the 'Add' chat button at the bottom left of the list of chats. A dialog box appears. 
*Enter the name of your chat in the first box. 
*Select players who will participate in the chat by checking / unchecking the boxes in the list. The players displayed in gray do not have a recent enough version of Rolisteam for this feature and can not be selected. In the example, only 'Jogo' and 'Paul' will be part of chat. 
*Click 'Ok'. 

# Changing a chat

Double-clicking on the name of a chat you created, the same dialog box that when you created it appears. You can change the name and composition of your chats. For players that you exclude the chat, it is as if you had deleted it. For players that you add, it is as if you were to create the chat. ''Be careful, the new players do not receive the old messages.'' 

# Deleting a chat

You can only delete the chats you have created yourself. 
* Select the chat to delete by clicking its name in the list. 
* Click 'Delete' button at the bottom right of the list of chats.

The chat window allows you to chat with other players and roll the dice. It consists of a display area at the top and a text box in the bottom, separated by a toolbar. There are different kinds of chat , but they are all used the same way. 

# Interact
*Type your text in the bottom text box. 
*Press the Enter key. 
Your text will appear in the display area (top), preceded by your name colored . Les The first two lines of the example were obtained this way. 
The text input area has a history. So you can recover and return what you have already typed using the up and down arrows on the keyboard.

# Puting yourself in the shoes of the character
* [[Connected_players#Create your character|Create your character]] if it is not already done. 
* Click on the multiple choices box in the left of the toolbar. 
* Click the name of the character you want to speak and act with. 
Now, what you say and what you do will be preceded by the name of the character you selected. This is the case in the example with the lines 2 and 3. 
It is also possible to change the character using Ctrl-up and Ctrl-down. 

# Emotes
Look at the 3rd line of the example. It is written in italics and there is no “ : “ between the name and the rest of the sentence. This is an emotion. It is generally used to describe the actions of his character. To do so, you must type in the text box a message that begins with “/ me”. For example to display a line similar to the 3rd line of the example: 
    ```/me pulls out his sword.```

# Save and backups
You can save a chat by clicking the icon [[File:IconSave.png]] in the chat toolbar. Also, all chats are automatically saved when closing Rolisteam . 
The chats are saved as HTML files in a folder configured by choosing ''Preferences'' from the ''File'' menu.



# v1.7.0

The background color has been improved to fit the background of text only.
