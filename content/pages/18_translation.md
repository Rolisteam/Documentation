Translation
===========

As you may noticed, Rolisteam has been translated in several languages.
When you start Rolisteam, it automatically recognizes the language of
your system and it loads the appropriated translation file, if
available.

Change the language
-------------------

You may force rolisteam to load one specific file. To do that, you have
two ways:

Through Preferences:

`  Preferences > Translation File > [...] `

Browse to the translation file, then press OK and restart the
application.

Parameter at start up:

`  ./rolisteam -t /path/to/translation/path`
