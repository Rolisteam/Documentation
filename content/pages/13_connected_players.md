List of players
===============

This window lists all connected players and their characters. The first
player on the list is always the local player (ie you). The GM is
indicated by a green background (on the example, it is 'Jogo'). The
names of the first level of the tree are the players ('Jogo', 'Paul' and
'James'). The names of the second level are the characters of the
players ('Aramis' is Paul PC).

Change the name or color
========================

By double-clicking your name or the name of one of your characters, you
can change them. The same way, by double-clicking on the color you can
change it.

Create a character
==================

At the launch of Rolisteam you have no character. In order to create
one:

-   Click on the bottom left button of the playerâ€™s window. Whether you
    are GM or not, this button is called Add a PC or Add NPC. A dialog
    box appears.
-   Enter the name of your new character in the first box.
-   Eventually change the color to represent it on maps and in chats by
    clicking on the colored button.

Remove one of his characters
============================

-   Click its name in the list of players.
-   Click the bottom right button of the players window. Whether you are
    GM or not, this button is called Delete NPC or Delete PJ.

Add or remove the character of a map
====================================

The check box on the line of a character indicates if his pawn is on the
last selected map. In the example, there are only the Cardinal and
Aramis on the map. To add or remove a character from the map, just check
or uncheck this box. The GM may add or remove all the characters. And
the players may act only on their own PCs.
