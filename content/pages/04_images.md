# Images 

The pictures allow all users to show the drawings or photos to other
players. This function can also be done by a map, however, the picture
uses much less memory. If your goal is simply to display a picture file,
without adding any amendments or annotations, use a picture, otherwise
use a map. Pictures are identifiable in the workspace as well as their
icon by the annotation "(picture)" in their title.

Unlike the maps, pictures can be opened by all users. To do this simply
click on "Open picture" in the "File" menu and select the picture file
(JPEG, PNG or BMP), it is transferred to all users. Closing the picture
window only hides it, which can be opened again by clicking its name in
the "Window" menu.

To permanently close a picture (and for it to be done for all users),
its owner (the one that opened it) or the GM should click on "Close Map
/ picture" in the "File" menu.

A picture can only be saved as part of a scenario ("Save scenario" in
the "File" menu).
